## New application plan

I want to build a modern web interface using ShadCN components.
Goal:

A landing page with option to enter Job description (textarea) for candidate search

A login page with standard email/password authentication after Job description fill

After login, a dashboard displays a grid of cards â€” each representing an matched specialist with skills and match (%)

Clicking a specialist  opens a detailed view with:

A header image

Skills and experience

Full candidate match description for each requirement in Job description

Please generate an implementation plan:

List the key components and pages to build

Suggest how to structure the project modularly

Recommend the tools/hooks/layout strategies to use for optimal UX

## Visual style guide [deep research]

Please create a comprehensive visual style guide for Iconicompany's landing pages, based on best practices for B2B SaaS conversion. The guide should include:

Color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors (with specific hex codes)

Typography recommendations for headings, subheadings, and body text

Button styles and hover states

Whitespace and spacing principles

Image and icon guidance

Mobile optimization principles

Layout and grid system

The visual style should convey technical expertise, trust, clarity, and innovation while optimizing for conversion. Please provide specific guidance that could be implemented by a designer or in a no-code tool.

The style should prioritize:

Clean, minimalist design that focuses attention on key messages

Strong visual hierarchy that guides the user through the page

Ample whitespace to improve readability

Strategic use of color to highlight CTAs

Mobile-first approach to ensure responsive design

Consistent visual language throughout the page
